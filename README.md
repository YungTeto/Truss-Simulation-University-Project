# Truss-Simulation-University-Project
Physical behavior of a 2D truss simulated using the finite element method.

The assignment came from my old university when I was a mechanical engineering student. The project contains of the following steps:
  1. Initialize Input Data and equation system
  2. Create element loop with needed matrices
     2.1 Create integration loop within element loop
  3. Solve equation system
  4. Save results and plot
